    profileSummary: "Hi, Iâ€™m Prachi ðŸ‘‹ - a grad student at Texas A&M whoâ€™s endlessly curious about all things AI/ML. Iâ€™ve built resume-matching bots, traffic-spotting detectors, and even a Fitbit dashboard that politely suggests when to skip dessert (oops). I love solving real-world problems with data and get equally excited about messy code fixes and clean, polished visualizations. When Iâ€™m not debugging, youâ€™ll probably find me chasing good coffee."
